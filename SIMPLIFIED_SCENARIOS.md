# ✅ Simplified: Removed Toggle, Scenarios Always Apply

## Changes Made

### Removed
- ❌ "Calculation Mode" toggle (Cost Savings Only vs Growth Attribution)
- ❌ Complex mode switching logic
- ❌ Confusing UI with two separate controls

### New Behavior
- ✅ Growth attribution is **ALWAYS** applied
- ✅ Only ONE control: Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive
- ✅ Simple, clear percentages

## Scenario Definitions

### Conservative: 10% Revenue Lift
- Year 1: 10% lift
- Year 2: 8% lift
- Year 3: 6% lift

### Moderate: 15% Revenue Lift (Default)
- Year 1: 15% lift
- Year 2: 12% lift  
- Year 3: 10% lift

### Aggressive: 20% Revenue Lift
- Year 1: 20% lift
- Year 2: 17% lift
- Year 3: 15% lift

## How It Works

### Example with Your Data
- Revenue: $200M
- Baseline Growth: 15%
- Margin: 20%
- Scenario: **Moderate (15% lift)**

#### Year 1 Calculation:
1. Baseline revenue: $200M × 1.15 = **$230M** (organic growth)
2. Platform lift: $230M × 15% = **$34.5M** (platform improvement)
3. Total Year 1: $230M + $34.5M = **$264.5M**
4. Gross profit from lift: $34.5M × 20% = **$6.9M**
5. Plus cost savings: $275K

**Total Year 1 Benefit**: $6.9M + $275K = **$7.175M**

## Expected Results (Your Test Data)

### Conservative (10%)
- **ROI**: ~1,100%
- Year 1 revenue lift: $23M
- 3-year GP benefit: ~$8.3M

### Moderate (15%)
- **ROI**: ~1,660%
- Year 1 revenue lift: $34.5M
- 3-year GP benefit: ~$12.5M

### Aggressive (20%)
- **ROI**: ~2,570%
- Year 1 revenue lift: $46M
- 3-year GP benefit: ~$19.3M

## What This Fixes

1. ✅ No more confusing toggle
2. ✅ Scenarios immediately update charts
3. ✅ Clear, simple percentages (10%, 15%, 20%)
4. ✅ Realistic ROI calculations
5. ✅ Cleaner UI - one control instead of two

## User Experience

**Before**: Toggle + Scenario buttons (confusing)
**After**: Just scenario buttons (simple!)

The charts and all numbers update immediately when you switch between Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive.
