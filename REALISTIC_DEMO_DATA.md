## Key Assumptions & Sources

### Growth Rate Assumptions
**Sources for Credibility**:
- Shopify Plus average merchant growth: 126% year-over-year (Shopify data)
- Industry benchmark for platform migration: 20-35% uplift (Forrester Research)
- Conservative approach: Use lower end of range

**Growth Drivers**:
1. **Conversion Rate Improvement**: 0.5-1.5 percentage points
   - Better mobile experience
   - Faster checkout
   - Modern UX/UI
   
2. **Average Order Value Increase**: 5-12%
   - Better product discovery
   - Upsell/cross-sell capabilities
   - Personalization features

3. **Operational Efficiency**: 
   - Reduced cart abandonment
   - Faster time-to-market for campaigns
   - Better inventory management

4. **New Channel Expansion**:
   - Headless commerce capabilities
   - Multi-channel selling
   - International expansion

### Cost Savings Assumptions
**Quantified Operational Inefficiencies** (Current State):
- Revenue leakage (cart abandonment, errors): $45,000/year
- Manual processing & workarounds: $20,000/year
- Integration maintenance tax: $12,000/year  
- Opportunity cost (slow development): $8,000/year
- **Total Addressable**: $85,000/year

**Post-Migration Recovery**:
- Conservative: 60% recovered ($50K/year)
- Moderate: 75% recovered ($65K/year)
- Aggressive: 90% recovered ($75K/year)

### Gross Margin
- **35%** is standard for mid-market commerce
- Source: U.S. Commerce Department, Shopify merchant data
- Can adjust per customer's actual margin

### Discount Rate
- **10%** is standard for NPV calculations
- Represents weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
- Conservative for private companies (typically 12-15%)

---

## Calculation Transparency

### ROI Formula
```
ROI = (Total Returns - Total Investment) / Total Investment × 100%

Where:
- Total Returns = Gross Profit Gains + Operational Savings
- Total Investment = Implementation Cost + Platform Costs (3 years)
```

### NPV Formula
```
NPV = Σ (Cash Flow_t / (1 + r)^t) - Initial Investment

Where:
- r = discount rate (10%)
- t = time period (years)
- Cash Flow includes both GP gains and cost savings
```

### Payback Period
```
Cumulative monthly returns until they equal initial investment
- Uses monthly gross profit gains + monthly savings
- Accounts for time value of money
```

## Credibility Checkers

### Red Flags to Avoid:
❌ ROI > 1000% (too good to be true)
❌ Payback < 3 months (unrealistic for platform migration)
❌ Growth rates > 50%/year sustained (not credible)
❌ 100% operational cost recovery (impossible)

### Green Flags (Credible):
✅ ROI: 150-600% over 3 years
✅ Payback: 6-18 months
✅ Growth rates: 15-35% year 1, tapering
✅ Cost recovery: 60-90% of identified waste
✅ Gross margins match industry
✅ All assumptions sourced and documented

- Shows you've stress-tested the model

### 4. Highlight Non-Financial Benefits
- Risk reduction
- Faster time-to-market
- Better customer experience
- Strategic optionality

## Implementation Notes

### In the Application:

1. **Default to Conservative Scenario** on load
2. **Show calculation methodology** in tooltip/modal
3. **Allow full customization** of all inputs
4. **Display assumptions clearly** with sources
5. **Include disclaimer**: "These projections are estimates based on industry benchmarks and may vary based on specific circumstances. Results not guaranteed."

6. **Add Benchmarking Context**:
   - "Your growth rate vs. industry average"
