## 🔍 What Should Match:

1. ✅ **Current costs add up correctly**: $300K + $50K + $50K + $50K = $450K
2. ✅ **Annual savings make sense**: $450K - $175K = $275K
3. ✅ **ROI is realistic**: (~9% not 5,000%!)
4. ✅ **Payback is reasonable**: (11 months not 5!)
5. ✅ **NPV is conservative**: (Can be negative when only counting cost savings)
6. ✅ **Cash flow matches**: Negative during implementation, breakeven at month 11

## 🚨 Red Flags (If You See These, Something's Wrong):

- ❌ ROI over 100%
- ❌ Payback under 8 months
- ❌ NPV in millions
- ❌ Year 1 position over $1M
- ❌ Current costs don't add up to $450K

## 💡 Notes:

**Why is NPV negative?**
- This is NORMAL and CONSERVATIVE
- We're only counting cost savings ($275K/year)
- We're NOT attributing revenue growth to the platform
- At 10% discount rate, the modest savings barely justify the investment
- In reality, there are other benefits (speed, scalability, etc.) not quantified here

**Why is ROI only 9%?**
- Again, this is REALISTIC
- 3-year savings: $825K
- 3-year investment: $755K
- Net benefit: $70K
- ROI = $70K / $755K = 9.27%

**This is a conservative, defensible business case focused on PROVEN cost savings only!**
