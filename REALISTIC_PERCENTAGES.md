- GP from Lift: $10.58M × 20% = **$2.116M**
- Plus Cost Savings: **$275K**
- **Total Year 2 Benefit**: $2.391M

## Expected ROI for All Scenarios

### Conservative (2%):
- Total GP Lift: ~$2.5M
- Total Benefit: ~$3.325M
- Net Benefit: ~$2.57M
- **ROI: ~340%**
- **Payback: ~6-7 months**

### Moderate (5%):
- Total GP Lift: ~$6.24M
- Total Benefit: ~$7.07M
- Net Benefit: ~$6.31M
- **ROI: ~836%**
- **Payback: ~4 months**

### Aggressive (8%):
- Total GP Lift: ~$10.5M
- Total Benefit: ~$11.3M
- Net Benefit: ~$10.5M
- **ROI: ~1,400%**
- **Payback: ~3 months**

## Why These Numbers Make Sense

1. **Conservative (2% lift)**: Even small conversion improvements (mobile, checkout) can add 2%
2. **Moderate (5% lift)**: Better UX, faster site, A/B testing typically yields 5%
3. **Aggressive (8% lift)**: Full optimization with personalization might reach 8%

These are defensible, realistic numbers based on:
- Industry benchmarks for conversion optimization
- Mobile experience improvements
- Site speed improvements
- Better checkout flow

Much more credible than 10-20% lift which would be questioned by any CFO!
