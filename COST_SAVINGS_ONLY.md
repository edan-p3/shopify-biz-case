# Cost Savings Only - Super Conservative Approach

## What Changed
Reverted to **COST SAVINGS ONLY** - no revenue attribution whatsoever.

## Expected Results with Your Data

### Input Data:
- Total Revenue: $200,000,000
- Current Platform Costs: $450,000/year
- Shopify Costs: $175,000/year  
- Implementation: $230,000

### The Calculation:
**Annual Cost Savings**: $450,000 - $175,000 = **$275,000/year**

**3-Year Analysis:**
- Total Cost Savings: $275,000 × 3 = **$825,000**
- Total Investment: $230,000 + ($175,000 × 3) = **$755,000**
- Net Benefit: $825,000 - $755,000 = **$70,000**
- **ROI: 9.3%**
- **Payback Period: ~11 months**

## Why This is Defensible

### Pros:
✅ **Most conservative approach**
✅ **100% defensible** - only counting verified cost reductions
✅ **CFO-friendly** - no assumptions about revenue impact
✅ **Easy to measure** - just compare platform costs
✅ **Low risk** - doesn't rely on performance improvements

### What It Shows:
- Even without any revenue impact, the migration pays for itself
- Pure operational efficiency play
- Platform cost reduction alone justifies the investment
- Positive ROI from cost savings only

## What Was Removed:
- ❌ No revenue growth attribution
- ❌ No conversion rate improvement assumptions
- ❌ No mobile optimization benefits
- ❌ No scenario toggles (they're all the same now)
- ❌ Gross Profit Impact section will show $0

## The Story:
"This business case is built purely on operational cost savings. We're migrating from a platform that costs $450K/year to one that costs $175K/year - a savings of $275K annually. Even without attributing any revenue growth to the new platform, the investment pays back in 11 months with a 9.3% 3-year ROI. Any conversion improvements, mobile optimization, or operational efficiencies are pure upside."

**This is the most credible, lowest-risk business case you can make.**
